# Group-Lab
Authors - Taranjot Kaur and Deepali Pareshkumar Vaghela In this lab we have developed a Rock, Paper and Scissors game. The game is a two players mode which means the user's opponent will be a computer. The game starts by asking the user to make a choice (rock, paper, scissors), if the choice is valid then the computer will randomly makes a choice and the winner will be declared. In case of an invalid input, an error will be displayed asking the user to try again. After declaring the winner, user will be asked whether to play again or exit. If the user would like to play again then the game will start from the beginning otherwise the game will end.

Overall, we worked as a team to complete this project. In order to work more efficiently and to complete project's tasks at time, we divided all the tasks between us.

Individual contribution to the Group-Lab is as follows: Taranjot worked on creating the plan for the lab and developing the first half of the project which is "iteration1" whereas Deepali contributed to the project by building the design for the game and constructing the second half of the project which is "iteration2". Testing was done to eradicate any bugs and errors affecting the performace of the game.

After succesful testing of the development portion, the final part of the project "Deploy" was completed by pushing our code to the production (main branch).
